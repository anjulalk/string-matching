USAGE
Linux: ./app.py text_file.txt pattern_file.txt output_file.txt
Windows: python text_file.txt pattern_file.txt output_file.txt

EXPLAINATION
The program takes 3 command line arguments: text file, pattern, and output file
It then tries to open the input and output files. If the files were not found it halts and returns an exit code
Then those files are passed over to the patternMatch function
The patternMatch function first read the files and save the content into variables
It uses naive approch to find the indexes where the pattern matches and saves them into the output file.
The naive algorithm is modified so that it skips over to the next character if an wildcard ('_') is found.
Complexity of the used algorithm: O(mn) where m and n are the lengths of text and pattern respectively.

RUNNING TESTS
Tests are scripted and can be executed with test.py file
Linux: ./test.py
Windows: python test.py
Input files are located inside the 'testdata' directory
Respective text, pattern and input file paths are stored in the test.py file
Correct expected outpu data is stored in the test.py file as well
When the test.py script is run it checks the output files with the given correct outputs
It then gives a score point for each matches. At the end a total percentage is calculated.
